# devilfpga

A recreation of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer on an FPGA. Why? Because.
Targeting the FPGA in the Analogue Pocket (Altera Cyclone V ACM-027-A4?), packaging the build as an OpenFPGA core. [Amaranth](https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/cover.html) HDL.

Omitting the sequencer, for now. Accent and glide seem crucial, so hopefully, soon(tm).

## Installation

### Requirements

- python 3, pip
- cython or pypy

Testing

- gtkwave

## TB-303 Design

(Below is my understanding of the TB-303's schematic. I am not an EE. If you know better, I'd love to hear from you :))

### Modules

- VCO
  - Background
    - The VCO supports both a sawtooth and square wave.
    - The sawtooth wave is generated 'directly' (Q28).
    - The square wave is generated by passing the saw through a waveshaper (Q8) (allegedly).
    - The sawtooth wave is passed through an anti-log amplifier (Q26)
  - Inputs
    - Tuning
    - Waveform (sawtooth vs square)
- VCF
  - The filter consists of a low-pass bjt (as diode) ladder filter, a bjt differential amp.
  - 24dB low-pass 4-pole resonant filter
  - Resonance - TBD
  - Decay - TBD
  - VCF Trim - TBD
  - The envelope generator drives te VCF.
- VCA
  - The envelope generator drives the VCA as well.
- Envelope Generator
  - The envelope generator only modulates decay, no attack / sustain / release.
- Mixer

## FPGA Implementation

### Waveforms

Waveforms are implemented via direct digital synthesis (DDS); the waveform is stored as discrete amplitude values in a waveform LUT, and a phase accumulator is incremented in such a way as to sample the LUT to produce a waveform of the desired frequency.

### Audio Out

The Analogue Pocket provides speakers, headphones through an I2C bus.
